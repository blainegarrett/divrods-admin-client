              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>MPLSART.COM was founded in 2005 by the incomparable designer/curator, Emma Berg. She saw a need for a consolidated, curated listing of important art events in the Twin Cities. In 2006, Emma was joined by fellow arts advocate, Kristoffer Knutson. Together, they ran the site and curated a host of exhibits and creativity-infused events. It was a work of passion, blood, sweat and so on.</p>

              <h2><b>Evolution</b></h2>
              <p>Ten years after the original launch, MPLSART.COM lives on under <PageLink to="/written/2015/01/new_beginnings_for_mplsart/">Blaine and Katie Garrett</PageLink>. The new owners are driven by sincere devotion to promoting the local scene. The re-build has just begun and the site will continue to evolve as a platform for event listings, discussions, artist promotion, and celebrating local success.</p>
